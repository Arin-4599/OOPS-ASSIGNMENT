        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of designing and writing software where you organize code around objects instead of actions or logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It defines:\n",
        "         What data the object will have (called attributes or properties)\n",
        "         What actions the object can do (called methods)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   -  an object is a real-world instance of a class.\n",
        "      If a class is the blueprint, then an object is the actual thing built from that blueprint — a living, working thing in your program that holds data and can do actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - abstraction means hiding complex information abstract class always be subclass\n",
        "   - encapsulation is Wrap data (attributes) and code (methods) together into one unit (the object) and restrict access to some parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - it is a special method or magic method define by built in class in python\n",
        "   - classes define these type of method for making custom object\n",
        "   - implement operator overloading in python\n",
        "   - all method associated with double underscore called dunder method\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPS?\n",
        "   - inheritance is making of sub class from parent class\n",
        "   - eg:- class parent:\n",
        "                def parent_info(self):\n",
        "                print(\"this is parent information\")\n",
        "          class child(parent):\n",
        "                def child_info(self):\n",
        "                print(\"this is child info\")\n",
        "   - inheritance is of many type like single, multiple, multilevel, herichrical, hybrid,\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOPS?\n",
        "   - polymorphism is made from poly and morphism in which poly means many and morphism means states or form\n",
        "   - refers to an object taking several forms depending on the methods/data\n",
        "   - polymorphism in oops takes place in two forms method overloading, method overriding\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - Encapsulation in Python is achieved mainly by restricting direct access to some parts of an object (usually the data/attributes) and providing controlled ways (methods) to read or modify them\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when you create an object from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its main job is to initialize the object’s attributes (set up the object with initial values\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - bound to the class(and not to a particular instance of the class) access/modify method and atributes associated to the class across all instance\n",
        "    - instead of self, cls as frist parameter\n",
        "    - class method can modify class state applicable to all the instance of the class\n",
        "    - static method it does not modify class, does not access class state\n",
        "    - it behave like plain function that belong to class\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    - Method Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different arguments (different number or types of parameters).\n",
        "    - The idea is: you can call the same method in different ways, depending on what you pass in.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOPS?\n",
        "    - Method overriding happens when a child (subclass) has a method with the same name and parameters as a method in its parent (superclass) — and it redefines or changes the behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - The @property decorator allows you to turn a method into a getter — meaning you can access it like an attribute without explicitly calling it as a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOPS?\n",
        "    - Reason\tWhy it Matters\n",
        "    - Flexibility\tYou can write one function that works with different types of objects.\n",
        "    - Reusability\tYou don’t have to rewrite code for each type of object.\n",
        "    - Scalability\tAdding new classes is easier because you don't have to change existing code.\n",
        "    - Cleaner Code\tIt removes lots of if-else checks and makes the code elegant and easy to maintain.\n",
        "    - Real-World Modeling\tReal-world objects often behave differently but share common actions (e.g., \"move\" for car, plane, boat)\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class cannot be directly instantiated (you can't create objects from it) and it may have abstract methods — methods that have no body (no implementation) and must be implemented by any subclass\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOPS?\n",
        "    -  Advantage :-\n",
        "    - Modularity\tCode is broken into small, independent pieces (classes/\n",
        "      objects). Easier to manage and organize.\n",
        "    - Reusability\tClasses can be reused across different programs.         Inheritance lets you extend existing code easily without rewriting.\n",
        "    - Scalability\tOOP makes it easy to scale applications as they grow bigger and more complex.\n",
        "    - Maintainability\tCode is easier to update, fix bugs, or add new features without breaking everything.\n",
        "    - Real-world Modeling\tObjects represent real-world entities (like a Car, Dog, Employee) making design intuitive and relatable.\n",
        "    - Encapsulation\tKeeps data safe by restricting direct access. Only specific methods can access or modify the data.\n",
        "    - Abstraction\tHide complex details and show only essential parts. Users don’t need to know how things work internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "     - class variable :- A variable that is shared by all instances of a class,\n",
        "        Directly inside the class, outside of any method, \tClass name or instance\n",
        "     - instance variable :- A variable that is unique to each object (instance),\n",
        "         Inside the class, usually inside a constructor (__init__) or other methods, Only by the instance (object) that owns it\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "     - Multiple Inheritance means that a class can inherit from more than one parent class at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "    - Both __str__ and __repr__ are special methods used to control how your objects are represented as strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "But they are used in slightly different ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Feature | __str__ | __repr__ | |:---|:---| | Goal | Create a nice, readable string for end-users. | Create a detailed, unambiguous string for developers. | | Audience | Users (people using your program). | Developers (people debugging your code). | | Used by | print(obj) or str(obj) | repr(obj) or just typing the object in the console. | | Fallback | If __str__ is missing, Python will use __repr__ as a fallback. | No fallback if __repr__ is missing (uses default from object class)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "    - super() is a built-in Python function used inside a class to call methods or constructors from its parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - __del__ is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is no longer needed and is being garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s used to clean up resources — like closing files, releasing memory, disconnecting from a network,\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "    - Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods inside a class that aren’t regular instance methods\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - In Python (and in OOP in general), polymorphism with inheritance allows different classes to be treated as if they are the same type because they share a common interface (like methods)\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOPS?\n",
        "    - Method chaining is a technique where you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line.\n",
        "    - Each method returns the object itself (self), so you can \"chain\" the next method right after it.\n",
        "\n",
        "It makes the code look cleaner, more readable, and compact\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, the __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - When you define __call__ in a class, you can \"call\" the object itself using parentheses () just like you would call a normal function\n",
